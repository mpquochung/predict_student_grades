# predict_student_grades
A small part of source code for my first paper
This git-hub is to upload a small part of source code for my paper. Note that the whole source code is, in fact, a lot. However, the previous code include private student information, so I can only upload the Machine Learning model experiments file.
The ML models include 5 base model: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, k-NN. These five models are then combined by using Stacking Classifier.
